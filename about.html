                <h2>What is the great space race?</h2>
                <p>Inspired by the cold war, its time to get cold with family and friends as you in different zero-gravity minigames in this reality show. Contestants are eliminated via minigames that include but are not limited to, "imposters", "team race", or "laser tag". Minigames have their own arenas specially made for each one, similar to space stations.</p>

                <h2>How safe is this?</h2>
                <p>As suits are not the right size for children, all people must be 16 or older to participate. All people must weigh less than 300 pounds. All suits are safe when used properly as shown in our 5-week pre-flight training course. Launch will take place one week after training in a SpaceX contracted modified Falcon 9 rocket that can carry up to 30 people. This means that landing will not take place in the ocean and instead safely on land.</p>
